## The `src` directory

The sample code for the session can be found here.

## The `database` directory

We're using the Sakila database provided by MySQL. See the `README.md` in the `mariadb` folder.

## `.devcontainer` directory

The `.devcontainer` is used for remote container development in Visual Studio Code. Feel free to use this if you would like a ready-to-code environment.

See the `docker-compose.yml` file in this same directory if you would like to know how the environment has been configured.

Please remember to install all the recommended Go extensions when Visual Studio Code prompts you to do so. You do not need to install the extensions for Docker and docker-compose.
